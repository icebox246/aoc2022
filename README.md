# Advent of Code 2022

This year I decided to write all the solutions in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), in order to practice using this language.

You can find this exercises [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

## Running 

To run a solution make sure the `filename` variable in a chosen source file points to a correct filepath (there should be a `test.in` file with example test case).

After setting up input, you  can just run this commands:

```console

cd dayXX
rustc dayXX.rs
./dayXX


```

; where `XX` is the number of a day
